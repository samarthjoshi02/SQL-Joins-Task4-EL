Business Insights (Task 4)

1) Customer mapping quality:
- Total orders: 500
- Orders that matched a customer record (by name): 180 (36.0%)
This indicates that many orders have customer names not present in the customers table, so joining by name can lose data. A unique CustomerID in orders would improve matching.

2) Best performing category:
- Highest revenue category: Main
- Revenue from this category: 7026.79
This category contributes the most to overall sales and should be prioritized for promotions/combos.

3) Product demand and payment preference:
- Top revenue food item: Pizza (2627.89)
- Payment method generating most revenue: Credit Card
The top food item can be highlighted as a bestseller, and the top payment method can be optimized with offers/discounts.
